🧠 1. Emotion Over Information
Principle: People are driven more by emotion than by facts when making decisions. Strong copy taps into feelings—fear, hope, pride, insecurity—rather than just listing features.

Example:
Instead of saying:

“We offer 24/7 customer support.”

Say:

“Never worry about a late-night emergency—our team is always one message away.”

Harry talks a lot about writing from pain, envy, hope, and persistence. These emotional currents help make a landing page resonate deeply.

✍️ 2. Make It Personal
Principle: Speak directly to the reader using second-person language ("you") and use real-life struggles or stories to build connection.

Example:
Instead of:

“Our product saves time.”

Say:

“You’re tired of wasting hours chasing your goals. Let’s fix that.”

Harry shares personal anecdotes ("I made $1.39 in my first month") to humanize the experience—your landing page can too.

🔁 3. Novelty Fades, Consistency Converts
Principle: Catchy headlines or gimmicks might draw attention, but people convert when your message shows consistency and trustworthiness.

Example:
Rather than changing your message every week, reinforce your core offer:

“Trusted by 20,000 creators every day. Here’s why they stay.”

This aligns with Harry’s idea that "novelty wears off, but persistence pays off." Your landing page should reflect long-term value, not short-term tricks.

🧩 4. Storytelling Over Listing
Principle: Instead of listing benefits or features, weave them into a narrative that shows a transformation.

Example:

“Three years ago, I was stuck. No audience, no income. Today, I’ve written 1,000+ articles, built a loyal following, and created a business I love. Here’s the system that made it happen.”

This approach grabs attention and builds trust.

🔍 5. Clarity Over Cleverness
Principle: A confused visitor doesn’t convert. Your copy should be punchy, readable, and clear. Don’t try to be witty if it sacrifices clarity.

Example: Instead of:

“Revolutionize your productivity paradigm!”

Say:

“Finally get more done—without burning out.”

Harry keeps his writing sharp, simple, and unpretentious—even when he's being clever.

🎯 6. Social Proof as Story, Not Stats
Principle: Social proof works best when embedded in human stories—not just numbers.

Example: Instead of just:

“Rated 4.9/5 by 2,300 users.”

Try:

“‘I never thought I could build a newsletter—until I followed these steps.’ — Sam, marketer turned creator.”

Harry uses email stories of other people’s struggles and wins. Replicate that feel on your landing page.

🚪 7. Create a Clear Call-to-Action with Emotion
Principle: Your CTA should be clear and emotionally tied to the problem you're solving.

Example:
Instead of:

“Start your free trial.”

Try:

“Start building your dream business—risk free.”

It speaks to what they want, not just what you offer.

📦 8. Use Curiosity Gaps
Principle: Make people want to click by revealing just enough and hinting at more.

Example:

“I spent 1,231 days writing online. Here’s what nobody tells you…”

This line makes you want to read more. Landing pages thrive on this—especially for scroll-triggered reveals or lead magnet sections.
