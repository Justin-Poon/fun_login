Report Hop – Smarter Reporting for Educators
Report Hop is an AI-powered assistant designed to transform how teachers write student reports. Built to save hours of work, it helps educators generate personalized, high-quality class reports in seconds. The platform is intuitive, friendly, and purpose-built for busy teachers who value clarity, professionalism, and time-saving tools.

Brand Strategy & Design Decisions
Logo & Visual Identity
The primary logo is "The H Leap" – a dynamic, open letter "H" that resembles a springboard or leaping motion, symbolizing both the name “Hop” and the jump in productivity Report Hop enables. The logo uses a vibrant gradient from Sky Blue (#4AA8F7) to Spring Green (#4AE597), representing intelligence, growth, and ease.

Typography
Primary Heading Font: DM Sans (Bold, Medium) – clean, approachable, and legible for web and mobile

Body Text Font: Work Sans (Regular, Light) – friendly and accessible with high readability

Code/Generated Text: JetBrains Mono – for showing structured AI output with clarity

Color Palette
Sky Blue: #4AA8F7 (clarity, trust, efficiency)

Spring Green: #4AE597 (growth, success, positivity)

Golden Accent: #FFC845 (warmth, achievement, encouragement)

Slate Gray: #4A4E57 (stability, professionalism)

Chalk White: #FAFAFA (clean, school-like simplicity)

Brand Elements
“Hoppy” Rabbit Mascot: A simple, geometric rabbit with a teacher’s clipboard, representing speed, helpfulness, and guidance

Flow Lines: Curved dotted lines that suggest movement across tasks, tying in the leap from effort to efficiency

App Icon: A rounded square with the blue-to-green gradient and a minimalist “H” cutout, echoing both a leap and an open book

Design Style Guidelines
The visual language should reflect education, lightness, and speed – clean lines, minimal friction, and visual moments of delight. The tone is supportive and professional, never robotic.

Use soft gradients, subtle animations, and spacious layouts to emphasize clarity. Elements should have rounded corners (4px for controls, 8px for cards and containers) with a soft shadow (0px 4px 10px rgba(74, 168, 247, 0.1)) to suggest tactility without clutter.

Charts and feedback summaries should follow the brand color order: blue → green → gold, using 60% opacity variants to show secondary data.
Typography hierarchy:

Headings: 26–32px

Subheadings: 18–22px

Body Text: 14–16px

Use the mascot “Hoppy” for onboarding, tips, and encouragement—but not within primary AI-generated content or critical UI functions.

All designs must meet AA/AAA accessibility standards, with strong contrast, easy-to-scan layouts, and support for dyslexia-friendly settings where possible.
